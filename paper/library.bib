abstract = {Quantum computation is a promising emerging technology which, compared to conventional computation, allows for substantial speed-ups, e.g., for integer factorization or database search. However, since physical realizations of quantum computers are in their infancy, a significant amount of research in this domain still relies on simulations of quantum computations on conventional machines. This causes a significant complexity which current state-of-the-art simulators try to tackle with a rather straight forward array-based representation and by applying massive hardware power. There also exist solutions based on decision diagrams (i.e., graph-based approaches) that try to tackle the exponential complexity by exploiting redundancies in quantum states and operations. However, these existing approaches do not fully exploit redundancies that are actually present. In this paper, we revisit the basics of quantum computation, investigate how corresponding quantum states and quantum operations can be represented even more compactly, and, eventually, simulated in a more efficient fashion. This leads to a new graph-based simulation approach which outperforms state-of-the-art simulators (array-based as well as graph-based). Experimental evaluations show that the proposed solution is capable of simulating quantum computations for more qubits than before, and in significantly less run-time (several magnitudes faster compared to previously proposed simulators).},

abstract = {Squeezed state in harmonic systems can be generated through a variety of techniques, including varying the oscillator frequency or using nonlinear two-photon Raman interaction. We focus on these two techniques to drive an initial thermal state into a final squeezed thermal state with controlled squeezing parameters—amplitude and phase—in arbitrary time. The protocols are designed through reverse engineering for both unitary and open dynamics. Control of the dissipation is achieved using stochastic processes, readily implementable via, e.g., continuous quantum measurements. Importantly, this allows controlling the state entropy and can be used for fast thermalization. The developed protocols are thus suited to generate squeezed thermal states at controlled temperature in arbitrary time.},

abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {We study a one-dimensional Fermi gas in the presence of dissipative coupling to environment through the Lindblad equation. The dissipation involves energy exchange with the environment and favours the relaxation of electrons to excitations. After switching on the dissipation, the system approaches a steady state, which is described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble. The fermionic single particle density matrix resembles deceivingly to that in a hermitian interaction quench. It decays inversely with the distance for short times due to the fermionic correlations in the initial state, which changes into a noninteger power law decay for late times, representing dissipation-induced Luttinger liquid behavior. However, the crossover between the two regions occurs due to dissipation-induced damping, and is unrelated to the propagation of excitations. The velocity of information spreading is set by the dissipative coupling, and differs significantly from the original sound velocity. The thermodynamic entropy grows as -t ln t initially, and saturates to an extensive value. Our results can be tested experimentally in one-dimensional Dirac systems.},

abstract = {We consider free fermion systems in arbitrary dimensions and represent the occupation pattern of each eigenstate as a classical binary string. We find that the Kolmogorov complexity of the string correctly captures the scaling behavior of its entanglement entropy (EE). In particular, the logarithmically-enhanced area law for EE in the ground state and the volume law for EE in typical highly excited states are reproduced. Since our approach does not require bipartitioning the system, it allows us to distinguish typical and atypical eigenstates directly by their intrinsic complexity. We reveal that the fraction of atypical eigenstates which do not thermalize in the free fermion system vanishes exponentially in the thermodynamic limit. Our results illustrate explicitly the connection between complexity and EE of individual pure states in quantum systems.},

Nevertheless, the optimization landscape of these algorithms is generally nonconvex, causing suboptimal solutions due to convergence to local, rather than global, minima. In this work, we introduce a variational quantum algorithm that uses classical Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to provably converge to global minima. These performance gaurantees are derived from the ergodicity of our algorithm's state space and enable us to place analytic bounds on its time-complexity. We demonstrate both the effectiveness of our technique and the validity of our analysis through quantum circuit simulations for MaxCut instances, solving these problems deterministically and with perfect accuracy. Our technique stands to broadly enrich the field of variational quantum algorithms, improving and gauranteeing the performance of these promising, yet often heuristic, methods.},

abstract = {Quantum Variational Circuits (QVCs) are often claimed as one of the most potent uses of both near term and long term quantum hardware. The standard approaches to optimizing these circuits rely on a classical system to compute the new parameters at every optimization step. However, this process can be extremely challenging, due to the nature of navigating the exponentially scaling complex Hilbert space, barren plateaus, and the noise present in all foreseeable quantum hardware. Although a variety of optimization algorithms are employed in practice, there is often a lack of theoretical or empirical motivations for this choice. To this end we empirically evaluate the potential of many common gradient and gradient free optimizers on a variety of optimization tasks. These tasks include both classical and quantum data based optimization routines. Our evaluations were conducted in both noise free and noisy simulations. The large number of problems and optimizers evaluated yields strong empirical guidance for choosing optimizers for QVCs that is currently lacking.},

abstract = {Quantum error correction is vital for implementing universal quantum computing. A key component is the encoding circuit that maps a product state of physical qubits into the encoded multipartite entangled logical state. Known methods are typically not "optimal"either in terms of the circuit depth (and therefore the error burden) or the specifics of the target platform, i.e., the native gates and topology of a system. This work introduces a variational compiler for efficiently finding the encoding circuit of general quantum error-correcting codes with given quantum hardware. Focusing on the noisy intermediate-scale quantum regime, we show how to systematically compile the circuit following an optimizing process seeking to minimize the number of noisy operations that are allowed by the noisy quantum hardware or to obtain the highest fidelity of the encoded state with noisy gates. We demonstrate our method by deriving efficient encoders for logic states of the five-qubit code and the seven-qubit Steane code. We describe ways to augment the discovered circuits with error detection. Our method is applicable quite generally for compiling the encoding circuits of quantum error-correcting codes.},

@article{Khatri2019,
abstract = {Compiling quantum algorithms for near-term quantum computers (accounting for connectivity and native gate alphabets) is a major challenge that has received significant attention both by industry and academia. Avoiding the exponential overhead of classical simulation of quantum dynamics will allow compilation of larger algorithms, and a strategy for this is to evaluate an algorithm's cost on a quantum computer. To this end, we propose a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm called quantum-assisted quantum compiling (QAQC). In QAQC, we use the overlap between a target unitary U and a trainable unitary V as the cost function to be evaluated on the quantum computer. More precisely, to ensure that QAQC scales well with problem size, our cost involves not only the global overlap Tr(V U) but also the local overlaps with respect to individual qubits. We introduce novel short-depth quantum circuits to quantify the terms in our cost function, and we prove that our cost cannot be efficiently approximated with a classical algorithm under reasonable complexity assumptions. We present both gradient-free and gradient-based approaches to minimizing this cost. As a demonstration of QAQC, we compile various one-qubit gates on IBM's and Rigetti's quantum computers into their respective native gate alphabets. Furthermore, we successfully simulate QAQC up to a problem size of 9 qubits, and these simulations highlight both the scalability of our cost function as well as the noise resilience of QAQC. Future applications of QAQC include algorithm depth compression, black-box compiling, noise mitigation, and benchmarking.},

abstract = {This article provides an introduction to surface code quantum computing. We first estimate the size and speed of a surface code quantum computer. We then introduce the concept of the stabilizer, using two qubits, and extend this concept to stabilizers acting on a two-dimensional array of physical qubits, on which we implement the surface code. We next describe how logical qubits are formed in the surface code array and give numerical estimates of their fault-tolerance. We outline how logical qubits are physically moved on the array, how qubit braid transformations are constructed, and how a braid between two logical qubits is equivalent to a controlled-NOT. We then describe the single-qubit Hadamard, ˆ S andˆTandˆ andˆT operators, completing the set of required gates for a universal quantum computer. We conclude by briefly discussing physical implementations of the surface code. We include a number of appendices in which we provide supplementary information to the main text. PACS numbers: 03.67.Lx In this article we describe the surface code approach to quantum computing. We have attempted to maximize clarity and simplicity, while perhaps sacrificing some rigor. The article is targeted at an audience with a good grounding in basic quantum mechanics, but assumes no additional knowledge regarding surface codes, error correction, or topological information processing. We do however assume some prior knowledge of the ba-sics of qubits and quantum computing, including familiarity with single qubit operations such asˆXasˆ asˆX bit-flips andˆZandˆ andˆZ phase-flips, the Hadamard gate, and the two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate as well as the multi-qubit Toffoli gate. We also assume a working understanding of quantum circuits and their terminology. We refer the uninitiated reader to one of the excellent texts on this topic, e.g. Ref. [1] or [2]. I. BACKGROUND Quantum computers provide a means to solve certain problems that cannot be solved in a reasonable period of time using a conventional, classical computer. These problems include factoring very large numbers into their primes, which on a quantum computer can be accomplished relatively quickly using Shor's algorithm [3], and searching large, unstructured data sets, which can be done on a quantum computer using Grover's search algorithm [4, 5]. A number of physical systems are being explored for their use in quantum computing, including ions, spins in semiconductors, and superconducting circuits [6, 7]. However, none of these systems perform sufficiently well to serve directly as computational qubits. It is however possible to construct a logical qubit from a collection of physical qubits, such that the logical qubit performs much better than the individual physical qubits. One approach to building a quantum computer is based on surface codes [8, 9], operated as stabilizer codes [10]. The surface codes evolved from an invention of Alexei Kitaev known as toric codes [11-14], which arose from his efforts to develop simple models for topological order, using qubits distributed on the surface of a toroid. The toroidal geometry employed by Kitaev turned out to be unnecessary, and planar versions (thus "surface codes") were developed by Bravyi and Kitaev as well as Freedman and Meyer [8, 15]. One of the significant advantages of surface codes is their relative tolerance to local errors, as was first described by Preskill and co-workers [16]. In this publication , the critical logical CNOT operation was implemented using stacked layers of surfaces, a three-dimensional structure that significantly complicates potential physical implementations, but the ability of the surface codes to withstand large error rates was apparent: These authors showed that the surface codes could handle error rates of almost 3{\%} per surface code clock cycle, assuming the ability to measure a four-qubit operator. Raussendorf and co-workers then discovered that the logical CNOT operation could be implemented by braid transformations on a single surface, a highly significant simplification [17-19]. These authors also evaluated error tolerances for a fully planar implementation using only one-and two-qubit nearest-neighbor gates, arriving at an},

abstract = {We give new evidence that quantum computers - moreover, rudimentary quantum computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements - cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers. In particular, we define a model of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically intractable under plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P{\#}P= BPPNP, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately, this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation. Our main result suggests that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven conjectures: the Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture, which says that it is {\#}P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1) Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture, which says that |Per(A)|{\textgreater}=√(n!)poly(n) with high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of which seem interesting even apart from our application. This paper does not assume knowledge of quantum optics. Indeed, part of its goal is to develop the beautiful theory of noninteracting bosons underlying our model, and its connection to the permanent function, in a self-contained way accessible to theoretical computer scientists. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {We describe a method for automatically recompiling a quantum circuit A into a target circuit B, with the goal that both circuits have the same action on a specific input i.e. A|in{\textgreater} = B|in{\textgreater}. This is of particular relevance to hybrid, NISQ-era algorithms for dynamical simulation or eigensolving. The user initially specifies B as a blank template: a layout of parameterised unitary gates configured to the identity. The compilation then proceeds using quantum hardware to perform an isomorphic energy-minimisation task, and optionally a gate elimination phase to compress the circuit. We use a recently introduced imaginary-time technique derived from McLachlan's variational principle. If the template for B is too shallow for perfect recompilation then the method will result in an approximate solution. As a demonstration we successfully recompile a 7-qubit circuit involving 186 gates of multiple types into an alternative form with a different topology, a far lower two-qubit gate count, and a smaller family of gate types. We test the scaling of our algorithm on up to 20 qubits, recompiling into circuits with up to 400 parameterized gates, and incorporate a novel adaptive timestep technique. We note that a classical simulation of the process can be useful to optimise circuits for today's prototypes, and more generally the method may enable `blind' compilation i.e. harnessing a device whose response to control parameters is deterministic but unknown.},

In this letter, we give a unified framework of transformations mapping fermionic systems to qubit systems. Many existed transformations, such as Jordan-Wigner, Bravyi-Kitaev and Parity transformations, are the special cases of this framework. Furthermore, based on our framework, one can design transformations flexibly according to the structure of Hamiltonian and quantum devices. Particularly, we propose a transformation, Multilayer Segmented Parity (MSP) transformation, in which the number of layers and the length of segments are adjustable. Applying these mappings on the electronic structure Hamiltonian of various molecules, MSP transformation performs better on the number of Pauli operators and gates needed in the circuit to implement the evolution operator of Hamiltonian.},

@article{Cotler2021,
abstract = {It has been shown that the apparent advantage of some quantum machine learning algorithms may be efficiently replicated using classical algorithms with suitable data access -- a process known as dequantization. Existing works on dequantization compare quantum algorithms which take copies of an n-qubit quantum state {\$}|x\backslashrangle = \backslashsum{\_}{\{}i{\}} x{\_}i |i\backslashrangle{\$} as input to classical algorithms which have sample and query (SQ) access to the vector {\$}x{\$}. In this note, we prove that classical algorithms with SQ access can accomplish some learning tasks exponentially faster than quantum algorithms with quantum state inputs. Because classical algorithms are a subset of quantum algorithms, this demonstrates that SQ access can sometimes be significantly more powerful than quantum state inputs. Our findings suggest that the absence of exponential quantum advantage in some learning tasks may be due to SQ access being too powerful relative to quantum state inputs. If we compare quantum algorithms with quantum state inputs to classical algorithms with access to measurement data on quantum states, the landscape of quantum advantage can be dramatically different.},

The first comprises of Operations Research (and Computer Science) graduate students who have familiarity with SDPs, but have found it daunting to become even minimally conversant with pre-requisites of QIS. The second audience consists of Physicists (and Electrical Engineers) who are looking to enhance their theoretical understanding of QIS with computational methods that are applicable more generally. For both audiences, we strive for rapid access to the unfamiliar material. For the first, we provide just enough required background material (from Quantum Mechanics, treated via matrices, and mapping them in Dirac notation) and simultaneously for the second audience we recreate, computationally in Jupyter notebooks, known closed-form solutions. We hope you will enjoy this little manuscript and gain understanding of the marvelous connection between SDP and QIS by self-study, or as a short seminar course. Ultimately, we hope this disciplinary outreach will fuel advances in QIS through their fruitful study via SDPs.},

abstract = {Monitored quantum circuits (MRCs) exhibit a measurement-induced phase transition between area-law and volume-law entanglement scaling. MRCs with a conserved charge additionally exhibit two distinct volume-law entangled phases that cannot be characterized by equilibrium notions of symmetry-breaking or topological order, but rather by the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady-state distribution of charge fluctuations. These include a charge-fuzzy phase in which charge information is rapidly scrambled leading to slowly decaying spatial fluctuations of charge in the steady state, and a charge-sharp phase in which measurements collapse quantum fluctuations of charge without destroying the volume-law entanglement of neutral degrees of freedom. By taking a continuous-time, weak-measurement limit, we construct a controlled replica field theory description of these phases and their intervening charge-sharpening transition in one spatial dimension. We find that the charge fuzzy phase is a critical phase with continuously evolving critical exponents that terminates in a modified Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to the short-range correlated charge-sharp phase. We numerically corroborate these scaling predictions also hold for discrete-time projective-measurement circuit models using large-scale matrix-product state simulations, and discuss generalizations to higher dimensions.},

In these codes; qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional array on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing; however, for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with Surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising framework for quantum computing architectures. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In recent years, the quantum computing community has seen an explosion of novel methods to implement non-Trivial quantum computations on near-Term hardware. An important direction of research has been to decompose an arbitrary entangled state, represented as a unitary, into a quantum circuit, that is, a sequence of gates supported by a quantum processor. It has been well known that circuits with longer decompositions and more entangling multi-qubit gates are error-prone for the current noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices. To this end, there has been a significant interest to develop heuristic-based methods to discover compact circuits. We contribute to this effort by proposing QuantumCircuitOpt (QCOpt), a novel open-source framework which implements mathematical optimization formulations and algorithms for decomposing arbitrary unitary gates into a sequence of hardware-native gates. A core innovation of QCOpt is that it provides optimality guarantees on the quantum circuits that it produces. In particular, we show that QCOpt can find up to 57{\%} reduction in the number of necessary gates on circuits with up to four qubits, and in run times less than a few minutes on commodity computing hardware. We also validate the efficacy of QCOpt as a tool for quantum circuit design in comparison with a naive brute-force enumeration algorithm. We also show how the QCOpt package can be adapted to various built-in types of native gate sets, based on different hardware platforms like those produced by IBM, Rigetti and Google. We hope this package will facilitate further algorithmic exploration for quantum processor designers, as well as quantum physicists.},

For RSTNs defined on a two-dimensional square lattice, we perform extensive numerical studies of entanglement phase transitions between volume-law and area-law entangled phases of the one-dimensional boundary states. These transitions occur when either (a) the bond dimension {\$}D{\$} of the constituent tensors is varied, or (b) the tensor network is subject to random breaking of bulk bonds, implemented by forced measurements. In the absence of broken bonds, we find that the RSTN supports a volume-law entangled boundary state with bond dimension {\$}D\backslashgeq3{\$} where {\$}D{\$} is a prime number, and an area-law entangled boundary state for {\$}D=2{\$}. Upon breaking bonds at random in the bulk with probability {\$}p{\$}, there exists a critical measurement rate {\$}p{\_}c{\$} for each {\$}D\backslashgeq 3{\$} above which the boundary state becomes area-law entangled.

In the next few years, new processors will be developed that support quantum computations exceeding the simulation ability of even the largest classical computer systems. A number of academic and industrial groups are developing prototypes of such devices, also known as NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) processors. Much as software must be compiled to run on classical computers, quantum algorithms must be compiled to take into account the constraints of particular NISQ devices. Especially in these early prototypes , algorithm performance degrades with runtime due to noise; for this reason, minimizing the runtime of the compiled algorithm (which is represented by a "quantum circuit") is critical. We describe a software framework to enable an automated reasoning approach to Quantum Circuit Compilation for NISQ architectures (QCC-NISQ), and our current implementation of it as part of software suite for automated, architecture-aware, compilation for emerging quantum computers. The key components of this suite are a circuit synthesizer , a QCC solver, and a visualizer.

abstract = {The dynamical signatures of an isolated quantum chaotic system are captured by the spectral form factor, which exhibits as a function of time a dip, a ramp, and a plateau, with the ramp being governed by the correlations in the level spacing distribution. These dynamical signatures are generally suppressed by decoherence. We consider the nonlinear non-Hermitian evolution associated with balanced gain and loss (BGL) in an energy-dephasing scenario and show that dissipation in this setting enhances manifestations of quantum chaos. Using the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model as a test-bed, BGL is shown to increase the span of the ramp, lowering the dip as well as the value of the plateau, providing an experimentally realizable physical mechanism for spectral filtering. The enhancement due to BGL is shown to be optimal with respect to the choice of the filter function.},

In measurement-based quantum computing, the need for a highly entangled initial state is particularly obvious. Defying this intuition, we show that quantum states can be too entangled to be useful for the purpose of computation, in that high values of the geometric measure of entanglement preclude states from offering a universal quantum computational speedup. We prove that this phenomenon occurs for a dramatic majority of all states: the fraction of useful n-qubit pure states is less than exp (-n2).

The circuit is then compressed by a sequential removal of two-qubit gates from the design, while the remaining building blocks are continuously adapted to the reduced gate structure by iterated learning cycles. We implemented the developed algorithm in the SQUANDER software package and benchmarked it against several state-of-the-art quantum gate synthesis tools.

abstract = {Quantum tomography is currently ubiquitous for testing any implementation of a quantum information processing device. Various sophisticated procedures for state and process reconstruction from measured data are well developed and benefit from precise knowledge of the model describing state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) apparatus. However, physical models suffer from intrinsic limitations as actual measurement operators and trial states cannot be known precisely. This scenario inevitably leads to SPAM errors degrading reconstruction performance. Here we develop a framework based on machine learning which generally applies to both the tomography and SPAM mitigation problem. We experimentally implement our method. We trained a supervised neural network to filter the experimental data and hence uncovered salient patterns that characterize the measurement probabilities for the original state and the ideal experimental apparatus free from SPAM errors. We compared the neural network state reconstruction protocol with a protocol treating SPAM errors by process tomography, as well as to an SPAM-agnostic protocol with idealized measurements. The average reconstruction fidelity is shown to be enhanced by 10{\%} and 27{\%}, respectively. The presented methods apply to the vast range of quantum experiments which rely on tomography.},

abstract = {The dynamics of open Markovian quantum systems are described by Lindblad master equations. For fermionic and bosonic systems that are quasi-free, i.e., with Hamiltonians that are quadratic in the ladder operators and Lindblad operators that are linear in the ladder operators, we derive the equation of motion for the covariance matrix. This determines the evolution of Gaussian initial states and the steady states, which are also Gaussian. Using ladder super-operators (a.k.a. third quantization), we show how the Liouvillian can be transformed to a many-body Jordan normal form which also reveals the full many-body spectrum. Extending previous work by Prosen and Seligman, we treat fermionic and bosonic systems on equal footing with Majorana operators, shorten and complete some derivations, also address the odd-parity sector for fermions, give a criterion for the existence of bosonic steady states, cover non-diagonalizable Liouvillians also for bosons, and include quadratic systems. In extension of the quasi-free open systems, quadratic open systems comprise additional Hermitian Lindblad operators that are quadratic in the ladder operators. While Gaussian states may then evolve into non-Gaussian states, the Liouvillian can still be transformed to a block-triangular form, and the equations of motion for k-point correlation functions form a closed hierarchy. Based on this formalism, results on criticality and dissipative phase transitions in such models will be discussed in a companion paper.},

abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms that are used for quantum machine learning rely on the ability to automatically differentiate parametrized quantum circuits with respect to underlying parameters. Here, we propose the rules for differentiating quantum circuits (unitaries) with arbitrary generators. Unlike the standard parameter shift rule valid for unitaries generated by operators with spectra limited to at most two unique eigenvalues (represented by involutory and idempotent operators), our approach also works for generators with a generic non-degenerate spectrum. Based on a spectral decomposition, we derive a simple recipe that allows explicit derivative evaluation. The derivative corresponds to the weighted sum of measured expectations for circuits with shifted parameters. The number of function evaluations is equal to the number of unique positive non-zero spectral gaps (eigenvalue differences) for the generator. We apply the approach to relevant examples of two-qubit gates, among others showing that the fSim gate can be differentiated using four measurements. Additionally, we present generalized differentiation rules for the case of Pauli string generators, based on distinct shifts (here named as the triangulation approach), and analyse the variance for derivative measurements in different scenarios. Our work offers a toolbox for the efficient hardware-oriented differentiation needed for circuit optimization and operator-based derivative representation.},

abstract = {We introduce a complex-plane generalization of the consecutive level-spacing distribution, used to distinguish regular from chaotic quantum spectra. Our approach features the distribution of complex-valued ratios between nearest- and next-to-nearest neighbor spacings. We show that this quantity can successfully detect the chaotic or regular nature of complex-valued spectra. This is done in two steps. First, we show that, if eigenvalues are uncorrelated, the distribution of complex spacing ratios is flat within the unit circle, whereas random matrices show a strong angular dependence in addition to the usual level repulsion. The universal fluctuations of Gaussian Unitary and Ginibre Unitary universality classes in the large-matrix-size limit are shown to be well described by Wigner-like surmises for small-size matrices with eigenvalues on the circle and on the two-torus, respectively. To study the latter case, we introduce the Toric Unitary Ensemble, characterized by a flat joint eigenvalue distribution on the two-torus. Second, we study different physical situations where nonhermitian matrices arise: dissipative quantum systems described by a Lindbladian, non-unitary quantum dynamics described by nonhermitian Hamiltonians, and classical stochastic processes. We show that known integrable models have a flat distribution of complex spacing ratios whereas generic cases, expected to be chaotic, conform to Random Matrix Theory predictions. Specifically, we were able to clearly distinguish chaotic from integrable dynamics in boundary-driven dissipative spin-chain Liouvillians and in the classical asymmetric simple exclusion process and to differentiate localized from delocalized phases in a nonhermitian disordered many-body system.},

Here, we simulate confinement dynamics in a {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\_}2{\$} LGT on a superconducting quantum chip. We synthesize the charge--gauge-field interaction using only 6 native two-qubit gates, enabling us to reach simulation times of up to 25 Trotter steps. We observe how tuning a term that couples only to the electric field confines the charges, a manifestation of the tight bond that the local gauge constraint generates between both. Moreover, we study a different mechanism, where a modification of the gauge constraint from a {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\_}2{\$} to {\$}U(1){\$} symmetry freezes the system dynamics. Our work showcases the dramatic restriction that the underlying gauge constraint imposes on the dynamics of an LGT, it illustrates how gauge constraints can be modified and protected, and it paves the way for studying other models governed by many-body interactions.},

As a non-trivial application, we rigorously resolve (following Furusaki) a recent controversy regarding the tunneling density of states, $\rho$dos($\omega$), at the site of an impurity in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid: we use finite-size refermionization to show exactly that for g = 1/2 its asymptotic low-energy behavior is $\rho$dos($\omega$) ∼ $\omega$. This agrees with the results of Fabrizio {\&} Gogolin and of Furusaki, but not with those of Oreg and Finkel'stein (probably because we capture effects not included in their mean-field treatment of the Coulomb gas that they obtained by an exact mapping; their treatment of anti-commutation relations in this mapping is correct, however, contrary to recent suggestions in the literature). - The tutorial is addressed to readers with little or no prior knowledge of bosonization, who are interested in seeing "all the details, explicitly; it is written at the level of beginning graduate students, requiring only knowledge of second quantization, but not of field theory (which is not needed here).

Phy., vol. 68, p. 012318, 2003), (Proc. 41st Design Automation Conf., 2004), (Proc. 39th Design Automation Conf., 2002), (Proc. Design, Automation, and Test Eur., 2004), (Phys. Rev. A, At. Mol. Opt. Phy., vol. 69, p. 062321, 2004), (IEEE Trans. Comput.-Aided Des. Integr. Circuits Syst., vol. 22, p. 710, 2003). Efficient quantum-logic circuits that perform two tasks are discussed: 1) implementing generic quantum computations, and 2) initializing quantum registers. In contrast to conventional computing, the latter task is nontrivial because the state space of an n-qubit register is not finite and contains exponential superpositions of classical bit-strings. The proposed circuits are asymptotically optimal for re- | spective tasks and improve earlier published results by at least a, factor of 2. The circuits for generic quantum computation constructed by the algorithms are the most efficient known today in terms of the number of most expensive gates [quantum controlled-NOTs (CNOTs)]. They are based on an analog of the Shannon decomposition of Boolean functions and a new circuit block, called quantum multiplexor (QMUX), which generalizes several known constructions. A theoretical lower bound implies that the circuits cannot be improved by more than a factor of 2. It is additionally shown how to accommodate the severe architectural limitation of using only nearest neighbor gates, which is representative of current implementation technologies. This increases the number of gates by almost an order of magnitude, but preserves the asymptotic optimality of gate counts. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Simulating quantum field theories is a flagship application of quantum computing. However, calculating experimentally relevant high energy scattering amplitudes entirely on a quantum computer is prohibitively difficult. It is well known that such high energy scattering processes can be factored into pieces that can be computed using well established perturbative techniques, and pieces which currently have to be simulated using classical Markov chain algorithms. These classical Markov chain simulation approaches work well to capture many of the salient features, but cannot capture all quantum effects. To exploit quantum resources in the most efficient way, we introduce a new paradigm for quantum algorithms in field theories. This approach uses quantum computers only for those parts of the problem which are not computable using existing techniques. In particular, we develop a polynomial time quantum final state shower that accurately models the effects of intermediate spin states similar to those present in high energy electroweak showers with a global evolution variable. The algorithm is explicitly demonstrated for a simplified quantum field theory on a quantum computer.},

However, determining the most suited encoding for unknown error channels or specific laboratory setups is highly challenging. Here, we present a reinforcement learning framework for optimizing and fault-tolerantly adapting quantum error correction codes. We consider a reinforcement learning agent tasked with modifying a family of surface code quantum memories until a desired logical error rate is reached. Using efficient simulations with about 70 data qubits with arbitrary connectivity, we demonstrate that such a reinforcement learning agent can determine near-optimal solutions, in terms of the number of data qubits, for various error models of interest. Moreover, we show that agents trained on one setting are able to successfully transfer their experience to different settings. This ability for transfer learning showcases the inherent strengths of reinforcement learning and the applicability of our approach for optimization from off-line simulations to on-line laboratory settings.},

We initiate this discussion by using principal bundles to geometrically characterize two-qubit PQCs. On the base manifold, we use the Mannoury-Fubini-Study metric to find a simple equation relating the Ricci scalar (geometry) and concurrence (entanglement). By calculating the Ricci scalar during a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) optimization process, this offers us a new perspective to how and why Quantum Natural Gradient outperforms the standard gradient descent. We argue that the key to the Quantum Natural Gradient's superior performance is its ability to find regions of high negative curvature early in the optimization process. These regions of high negative curvature appear to be important in accelerating the optimization process.},

abstract = {An ultimate goal of quantum computing is to perform calculations beyond the reach of any classical computer. It is therefore imperative that useful quantum computers be very difficult to simulate classically, otherwise classical computers could be used for the applications envisioned for the quantum ones. Perfect quantum computers are unarguably exponentially difficult to simulate: the classical resources required grow exponentially with the number of qubits N or the depth D of the circuit. This difficulty has triggered recent experiments on deep, random circuits that aim to demonstrate that quantum devices may already perform tasks beyond the reach of classical computing. These real quantum computing devices, however, suffer from many sources of decoherence and imprecision which limit the degree of entanglement that can actually be reached to a fraction of its theoretical maximum. They are characterized by an exponentially decaying fidelity F∼(1-ϵ)ND with an error rate ϵ per operation as small as ≈1{\%} for current devices with several dozen qubits or even smaller for smaller devices. In this work, we provide new insight on the computing capabilities of real quantum computers by demonstrating that they can be simulated at a tiny fraction of the cost that would be needed for a perfect quantum computer. Our algorithms compress the representations of quantum wave functions using matrix product states, which are able to capture states with low to moderate entanglement very accurately. This compression introduces a finite error rate ϵ so that the algorithms closely mimic the behavior of real quantum computing devices. The computing time of our algorithm increases only linearly with N and D in sharp contrast with exact simulation algorithms. We illustrate our algorithms with simulations of random circuits for qubits connected in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. We find that ϵ can be decreased at a polynomial cost in computing power down to a minimum error ϵ∞. Getting below ϵ∞ requires computing resources that increase exponentially with ϵ∞/ϵ. For a two-dimensional array of N=54 qubits and a circuit with control-Z gates, error rates better than state-of-the-art devices can be obtained on a laptop in a few hours. For more complex gates such as a swap gate followed by a controlled rotation, the error rate increases by a factor 3 for similar computing time. Our results suggest that, despite the high fidelity reached by quantum devices, only a tiny fraction (∼10-8) of the system Hilbert space is actually being exploited.},

abstract = {Quantum simulation, one of the most promising applications of a quantum computer, is currently being explored intensely using the variational quantum eigensolver. The feasibility and performance of this algorithm depend critically on the form of the wave-function ansatz. Recently in Ref. [Nat. Commun. 10, 3007 (2019)], an algorithm termed ADAPT-VQE was introduced to build system-adapted ans{\"{a}}tze with substantially fewer variational parameters compared to other approaches. This algorithm relies heavily on a predefined operator pool with which it builds the ansatz. However, Ref. [Nat. Commun. 10, 3007 (2019)] did not provide a prescription for how to select the pool, how many operators it must contain, or whether the resulting ansatz will succeed in converging to the ground state. In addition, the pool used in that work leads to state-preparation circuits that are too deep for a practical application on near-term devices. Here, we address all these key outstanding issues of the algorithm. We present a hardware-efficient variant of ADAPT-VQE that drastically reduces circuit depths using an operator pool that is guaranteed to contain the operators necessary to construct exact ans{\"{a}}tze. Moreover, we show that the minimal pool size that achieves this scales linearly with the number of qubits. Through numerical simulations on H4, LiH and H6, we show that our algorithm ("qubit-ADAPT") reduces the circuit depth by an order of magnitude while maintaining the same accuracy as the original ADAPT-VQE. A central result of our approach is that the additional measurement overhead of qubit-ADAPT compared to fixed-ansatz variational algorithms scales only linearly with the number of qubits. Our work provides a crucial step forward in running algorithms on near-term quantum devices.},

In this Letter, we show that some real-time problems in open fermion systems can be simulated using the quantum Monte Carlo. To this end, we prescribe a mapping between a real-time problem in open quantum systems and a statistical problem in non-Hermitian quantum systems; for some cases, the latter can be solved without suffering from the complex measure problem. To explain our idea and demonstrate how it works, we compute the real-time evolution of fidelities in open fermion systems under dissipation.},

Key features of QUANTIFY include: (1) analysis and optimisation methods which are compatible with the surface code, (2) choice between different automated (mixed polarity) Toffoli gate decompositions, (3) semi-automatic quantum circuit rewriting and quantum gate insertion methods that take into account known gate commutation rules, and (4) novel optimiser types that can be combined with different verification methods (e.g. truth table or circuit invariants like number of wires). For benchmarking purposes QUANTIFY includes quantum memory and quantum arithmetic circuits. Experimental results show that the framework's performance scales to circuits with thousands of qubits.},

Very early on it was realized that the zoo of emerging states of matter would need to be understood in a systematic manner. The first attempts to do this, by Haldane and Halperin, set an agenda for further work which has continued to this day. Since that time the idea of hierarchies of quasiparticles condensing to form new states has been a pillar of our understanding of fractional quantum Hall physics. In the 30 years that have passed since then, a number of new directions of thought have advanced our understanding of fractional quantum Hall states and have extended it in new and unexpected ways. Among these directions is the extensive use of topological quantum field theories and conformal field theories, the application of the ideas of composite bosons and fermions, and the study of non-Abelian quantum Hall liquids. This article aims to present a comprehensive overview of this field, including the most recent developments.},

Often this leads to a similar exponential scaling of the experimental resources required to characterize the state. Contrary to this, we propose a physically-motivated method for experimentally assessing the fidelity of an important class of entangled states known as cluster states. The proposed method always yields a lower bound of the fidelity with a number of measurement settings scaling only linearly with the system size, and is tailored to correctly account for the errors most likely to occur in experiments. For one-dimensional cluster states, the constructed fidelity measure is tight to lowest order in the error probability for experimentally realistic noise sources and thus closely matches the true fidelity. Furthermore, it is tight for the majority of higher-order errors, except for a small subset of certain non-local multiqubit errors irrelevant in typical experimental situations. The scheme also performs very well for higher-dimensional cluster states, including correctly the majority of experimentally relevant errors.},

Such regularization is interesting since (1) it can greatly speed up training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. AIC and BIC, well-known model selection criteria, are special cases of L0 regularization. However, since the L0 norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the expected L0 regularized objective is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the hard concrete distribution for the gates, which is obtained by “stretching” a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method allows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a principled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting approach and regularizer.},

abstract = {Realizing a conceptual quantum algorithm on an actual physical device necessitates the algorithm's quantum circuit description to undergo certain transformations in order to adhere to all constraints imposed by the hardware. In this regard, the individual high-level circuit components are first synthesized to the supported low-level gate-set of the quantum computer, before being mapped to the target's architecture-utilizing several optimizations in order to improve the compilation result. Specialized tools for this complex task exist, e.g., IBM's Qiskit, Google's Cirq, Microsoft's QDK, or Rigetti's Forest. However, to date, the circuits resulting from these tools are hardly verified, which is mainly due to the immense complexity of checking if two quantum circuits indeed realize the same functionality. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme for quantum circuit equivalence checking - specialized for verifying results of the IBM Qiskit quantum circuit compilation flow. To this end, we combine characteristics unique to quantum computing, e.g., its inherent reversibility, and certain knowledge about the compilation flow into a dedicated equivalence checking strategy. Experimental evaluations confirm that the proposed scheme allows to verify even large circuit instances with tens of thousands of operations within seconds or even less, whereas state-of-the-art techniques frequently time-out or require substantially more runtime. A corresponding open source implementation of the proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/iic-jku/qcec.},

We can construct the CCZ gate with only four CZ-depth when the qubit is square-shaped, including one auxiliary qubit. In T-shaped qubit connectivity, which has no closed loop, we can decompose the CCCZ gate with 17 CZ gates. While previous studies have shown a CCCZ gate decomposition with 14 CZ gates for the fully connected case, we found only four connections are sufficient for 14 CZ gates' implementation. The search for constraint-sufficient decompositions is aided by an optimization method we devised to bring the parameterized quantum circuit closer to the target quantum gate. We can apply this scheme to decompose any quantum gates, not only CCZ and CCCZ. Such decompositions of multi-qubit gates, together with the newly found CCZ and CCCZ decompositions, shorten the execution time of quantum circuits and improve the accuracy of complex quantum algorithms on near future QPUs.},

abstract = {Unitary transformations formulate the time evolution of quantum states. How to learn a unitary transformation efficiently is a fundamental problem in quantum machine learning. The most natural and leading strategy is to train a quantum machine learning model based on a quantum dataset. Although presence of more training data results in better models, using too much data reduces the efficiency of training. In this work, we solve the problem on the minimum size of sufficient quantum datasets for learning a unitary transformation exactly, which reveals the power and limitation of quantum data. First, we prove that the minimum size of dataset with pure states is {\$}2{\^{}}n{\$} for learning an {\$}n{\$}-qubit unitary transformation. To fully explore the capability of quantum data, we introduce a quantum dataset consisting of {\$}n+1{\$} mixed states that are sufficient for exact training. The main idea is to simplify the structure utilizing decoupling, which leads to an exponential improvement on the size over the datasets with pure states. Furthermore, we show that the size of quantum dataset with mixed states can be reduced to a constant, which yields an optimal quantum dataset for learning a unitary. We showcase the applications of our results in oracle compiling and Hamiltonian simulation. Notably, to accurately simulate a 3-qubit one-dimensional nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model, our circuit only uses {\$}48{\$} elementary quantum gates, which is significantly less than {\$}4320{\$} gates in the circuit constructed by the Trotter-Suzuki product formula.},

Though this decomposition has been known for at least 10 years, we provide here the first demonstration of its CNOT-optimality. We study three-qubit circuits which contain less than six CNOT gates and implement a block-diagonal operator, then show that they implicitly describe the cosine-sine decomposition of a related operator. Leveraging the canonical nature of such decompositions to limit one-qubit gates appearing in respective circuits, we prove that the n-qubit analogue of the TOFFOLI requires at least 2n CNOT gates.

We find that while ADAPT-VQE does not remove local minima, the gradient-informed, one-operator-at-a-time circuit construction seems to accomplish two things: First, it provides an initialization strategy that is dramatically better than random initialization, and which is applicable in situations where chemical intuition cannot help with initialization, i.e., when Hartree-Fock is a poor approximation to the ground state. Second, even if an ADAPT-VQE iteration converges to a local trap at one step, it can still "burrow" toward the exact solution by adding more operators, which preferentially deepens the occupied trap. This same mechanism helps highlight a surprising feature of ADAPT-VQE: It should not suffer optimization problems due to "barren plateaus". Even if barren plateaus appear in the parameter landscape, our analysis and simulations reveal that ADAPT-VQE avoids such regions by design.},

abstract = {Repeated local measurements of quantum many body systems can induce a phase transition in their entanglement structure. These measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) have been studied for various types of dynamics, yet most cases yield quantitatively similar values of the critical exponents, making it unclear if there is only one underlying universality class. Here, we directly probe the properties of the conformal field theories governing these MIPTs using a numerical transfer-matrix method, which allows us to extract the effective central charge, as well as the first few low-lying scaling dimensions of operators at these critical points. Our results provide convincing evidence that the generic and Clifford MIPTs for qubits lie in different universality classes and that both are distinct from the percolation transition for qudits in the limit of large onsite Hilbert space dimension. For the generic case, we find strong evidence of multifractal scaling of correlation functions at the critical point, reflected in a continuous spectrum of scaling dimensions.},

abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising methods to demonstrate quantum advantage on near-term devices as the required resources are divided between a quantum simulator and a classical optimizer. As such, designing a VQA which is resource-efficient and robust against noise is a key factor to achieve potential advantage with the existing noisy quantum simulators. It turns out that a fixed VQA circuit design, such as the widely-used hardware efficient ansatz, is not necessarily robust against imperfections. In this work, we propose a genome-length-adjustable evolutionary algorithm to design a robust VQA circuit that is optimized over variations of both circuit ansatz and gate parameters, without any prior assumptions on circuit structure or depth. Remarkably, our method not only generates a noise-effect-minimized circuit with shallow depth, but also accelerates the classical optimization by substantially reducing the number of parameters. In this regard, the optimized circuit is far more resource-efficient with respect to both quantum and classical resources. As applications, based on two typical error models in VQA, we apply our method to calculating the ground energy of the hydrogen molecule and the Heisenberg model. Simulations suggest that compared with conventional hardware efficient ansatz, our circuit-structure-tunable method can generate circuits apparently more robust against both coherent and incoherent noise, and hence more likely to be implemented on near-term devices.},

abstract = {Due to little consideration in the hardware constraints, e.g., limited connections between physical qubits to enable two-qubit gates, most quantum algorithms cannot be directly executed on the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Dynamically remapping logical qubits to physical qubits in the compiler is needed to enable the two-qubit gates in the algorithm, which introduces additional operations and inevitably reduces the fidelity of the algorithm. Previous solutions in finding such remapping suffer from high complexity, poor initial mapping quality, and limited flexibility and controllability. To address these drawbacks mentioned above, this paper proposes a SWAP-based BidiREctional heuristic search algorithm SABRE, which is applicable to NISQ devices with arbitrary connections between qubits. By optimizing every search attempt,globally optimizing the initial mapping using a novel reverse traversal technique, introducing the decay effect to enable the trade-off between the depth and the number of gates of the entire algorithm, SABRE outperforms the best known algorithm with exponential speedup and comparable or better results on various benchmarks.},

The field expressions in air with the form of Sommerfeld integral are rapidly and efficiently evaluated by the fast Fourier transform method.

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.},

In any particular case, the nature of the underlying control landscape is fundamentally important for systematic optimization of the objective. In early studies on the optimal control of few-body dynamics, the optimizer could take full control of the quantum systems to be manipulated whose Hilbert space dimension is relatively small. Stepping into the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, the experimentally growing computational power of the ansatz expressed as quantum hardware may bring quantum advantage over classical computers, but the classical optimizer is often limited by the available control resources. Across these different scales, we will show that the landscape's geometry experiences morphological changes from favorable trap-free landscapes to easily trapping rugged landscapes, and eventually to barren-plateau landscapes on which the optimizer can hardly move. This unified view provides the basis for understanding classes of systems that may be readily controlled out to those with special consideration, including the difficulties and potential advantages of NISQ technologies, as well as seeking possible ways to escape traps or plateaus, in particular circumstances.},

abstract = {We propose a sequential minimal optimization method for quantum-classical hybrid algorithms, which converges faster, robust against statistical error, and hyperparameter-free. Specifically, the optimization problem of the parameterized quantum circuits is divided into solvable subproblems by considering only a subset of the parameters. In fact, if we choose a single parameter, the cost function becomes a simple sine curve with period 2$\pi$, and hence we can exactly minimize with respect to the chosen parameter. Furthermore, even in general cases, the cost function is given by a simple sum of trigonometric functions with certain periods and hence can be minimized by using a classical computer. By repeatedly performing this procedure, we can optimize the parameterized quantum circuits so that the cost function becomes as small as possible. We perform numerical simulations and compare the proposed method with existing gradient-free and gradient-based optimization algorithms. We find that the proposed method substantially outperforms the existing optimization algorithms and converges to a solution almost independent of the initial choice of the parameters. This accelerates almost all quantum-classical hybrid algorithms readily and would be a key tool for harnessing near-term quantum devices.},

abstract = {Quantum computers can be used to address molecular structure, materials science and condensed matter physics problems, which currently stretch the limits of existing high-performance computing resources. Finding exact numerical solutions to these interacting fermion problems has exponential cost, while Monte Carlo methods are plagued by the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made even few-atom molecular structures problems of practical interest for medium-sized quantum computers. Yet, thus far experimental implementations have been restricted to molecules involving only Period I elements. Here, we demonstrate the experimental optimization of up to six-qubit Hamiltonian problems with over a hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH2. This is enabled by a hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver with trial states specifically tailored to the available interactions in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization routine. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying the technique to a problem of quantum magnetism. Across all studied problems, we find agreement between experiment and numerical simulations with a noisy model of the device. These results help elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems, and aim at bridging the gap between problems at the forefront of high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.},

@article{Zulehner2019,
abstract = {In the past years, quantum computers more and more have evolved from an academic idea to an upcoming reality. IBM's project IBM Q can be seen as evidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to provide access to quantum computers for a broad audience, this allowed users to conduct quantum experiments on a 5-qubit and, since June 2017, also on a 16-qubit quantum computer (called IBM QX2 and IBM QX3, respectively). Revised versions of these 5- and 16-qubit quantum computers (named IBM QX4 and IBM QX5, respectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these, the desired quantum functionality (e.g., provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has to be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied - a complex task. This demands solutions to automatically and efficiently conduct this mapping process. In this paper, we propose a methodology which addresses this problem, i.e., maps the given quantum functionality to a realization which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and, at the same time, keeps the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum gates minimal. The proposed methodology is generic, can easily be configured for similar future architectures, and is fully integrated into IBM's SDK. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms IBM's own mapping solution. In fact, for many quantum circuits, the proposed approach determines a mapping to the IBM architecture within minutes, while IBM's solution suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 h in several cases. As an additional benefit, the proposed approach yields mapped circuits with smaller costs (i.e., fewer additional gates are required). All implementations of the proposed methodology are publicly available at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/ibm-qx-mapping.},

A variational pulse-shaping algorithm known as ctrl-VQE was recently proposed to address this issue by eliminating the need for parameterized quantum circuits, which lead to long state preparation times. Here, we find the shortest possible pulses for ctrl-VQE to prepare target molecular wavefunctions for a given device Hamiltonian describing coupled transmon qubits. We find that the time-optimal pulses that do this have a bang-bang form consistent with Pontryagin's maximum principle. We further investigate how the minimal state preparation time is impacted by truncating the transmons to two versus more levels. We find that leakage outside the computational subspace (something that is usually considered problematic) speeds up the state preparation, further reducing device coherence-time demands. This speedup is due to an enlarged solution space of target wavefunctions and to the appearance of additional channels connecting initial and target states.},

Our classifier is directly fed labeled states recovered by the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, thereby avoiding the data-reading slowdown experienced in many applications of quantum enhanced machine learning.

This is of particular relevance to hybrid, NISQ-era algorithms for dynamical simulation or eigensolving. The user initially specifies B as a blank template: a layout of parameterised unitary gates configured to the identity. The compilation then proceeds using quantum hardware to perform an isomorphic energy-minimisation task, and optionally a gate elimination phase to compress the circuit. We use a recently introduced imaginary-time technique derived from McLachlan's variational principle. If the template for B is too shallow for perfect recompilation then the method will result in an approximate solution. As a demonstration we successfully recompile a 7-qubit circuit involving 186 gates of multiple types into an alternative form with a different topology, a far lower two-qubit gate count, and a smaller family of gate types. We test the scaling of our algorithm on up to 20 qubits, recompiling into circuits with up to 400 parameterized gates, and incorporate a novel adaptive timestep technique. We note that a classical simulation of the process can be useful to optimise circuits for today's prototypes, and more generally the method may enable `blind' compilation i.e. harnessing a device whose response to control parameters is deterministic but unknown.},

abstract = {Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) rely upon the iterative optimization of a parameterized unitary circuit with respect to an objective function. Since quantum machines are noisy and expensive resources, it is imperative to choose a VQA's ansatz appropriately and its initial parameters to be close to optimal. This work tackles the problem of finding initial ansatz parameters by proposing CAFQA, a Clifford ansatz for quantum accuracy. The CAFQA ansatz is a hardware-efficient circuit built with only Clifford gates. In this ansatz, the initial parameters for the tunable gates are chosen by searching efficiently through the Clifford parameter space via classical simulation, thereby producing a suitable stabilizer state. The stabilizer states produced are shown to always equal or outperform traditional classical initialization (e.g., Hartree-Fock), and often produce high accuracy estimations prior to quantum exploration. Furthermore, the technique is classically suited since a) Clifford circuits can be exactly simulated classically in polynomial time and b) the discrete Clifford space, while scaling exponentially in the number of qubits, is searched efficiently via Bayesian Optimization. For the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) task of molecular ground state energy estimation up to 20 qubits, CAFQA's Clifford Ansatz achieves a mean accuracy of near 99{\%}, recovering as much as 99.99{\%} of the correlation energy over Hartree-Fock. Notably, the scalability of the approach allows for preliminary ground state energy estimation of the challenging Chromium dimer with an accuracy greater than Hartree-Fock. With CAFQA's initialization, VQA convergence is accelerated by a factor of 2.5x. In all, this work shows that stabilizer states are an accurate ansatz initialization for VQAs. Furthermore, it highlights the potential for quantum-inspired classical techniques to support VQAs.},

Cat qubits are a promising realization of biased-noised qubits as they feature an exponential error bias inherited from their non-local encoding in the phase space of a quantum harmonic oscillator. To confine the state of an oscillator to the cat qubit manifold, two main approaches have been considered so far: a Kerr-based Hamiltonian confinement with high gate performances, and a dissipative confinement with robust protection against a broad range of noise mechanisms. We introduce a new combined dissipative and Hamiltonian confinement scheme based on two-photon dissipation together with a Two-Photon Exchange (TPE) Hamiltonian. The TPE Hamiltonian is similar to Kerr nonlinearity, but unlike the Kerr it only induces a bounded distinction between even- and odd-photon eigenstates, a highly beneficial feature for protecting the cat qubits with dissipative mechanisms. Using this combined confinement scheme, we demonstrate fast and bias-preserving gates with drastically improved performance compared to dissipative or Hamiltonian schemes. In addition, this combined scheme can be implemented experimentally with only minor modifications of existing dissipative cat qubit experiments.},

abstract = {The unitarity of quantum evolutions implies that the overlap between two initial states does not change in time. This property is commonly believed to explain the lack of state sensitivity in quantum theory, a feature that is prevailing in classical chaotic systems. However, a distance between two points in classical phase space is a completely different mathematical concept than an overlap distance between two points in Hilbert space. There is a possibility that state sensitivity in quantum theory can be uncovered with a help of some other metric. Here we show that the recently introduced Weighted Bures Length (WBL) achieves this task. In particular, we numerically study a cellular automaton-like unitary evolution of N qubits, known as Rule 54, and apply WBL to show that a single-qubit perturbation of a random initial state: (a) grows linearly in time under the nearest neighbour interaction on a cycle, (b) appears to grow exponentially in time under interaction given by a random bipartite graph.},

abstract = {Quantum regression theorem is a very useful result in open quantum system and extensively used for computing multi-point correlation functions. Traditionally it is derived for two-time correlators in the Markovian limit employing the Schr$\backslash$"odinger picture. In this paper we make use of the Heisenberg picture to derive quantum regression theorems for multi-time correlation functions which in the special limit reduce to the well known two-time regression theorem. For multi-time correlation function we find that the regression theorem takes the same form as it takes for two-time correlation function with a mild restriction that one of the times should be greater than all the other time variables. Interestingly, the Heisenberg picture also allows us to derive analogue of regression theorem for out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). We further extend our study for the case of non-Markovian dynamics and report the modifications to the standard quantum regression theorem. We illustrate all of the above results using the paradigmatic dissipative spin-boson model.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical work has shown that the competition between coherent unitary dynamics and stochastic measurements, performed by the environment, along wavefunction trajectories can give rise to transitions in the entanglement scaling. In this work, complementary to these previous studies, we analyze a situation where the role of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics is reversed. We consider an engineered dissipation, which stabilizes an entangled phase of a quantum spin{\$}-1/2{\$} chain, while competing single-particle or interacting Hamiltonian dynamics induce a disentangled phase. Focusing on the single-particle unitary dynamics, we find that the system undergoes an entanglement transition from a logarithmic growth to an area law when the competition ratio between the unitary evolution and the non-unitary dynamics increases. We evidence that the transition manifests itself in state-dependent observables at a finite competition ratio for Hamiltonian and measurement dynamics. On the other hand, it is absent in trajectory-averaged steady-state dynamics, governed by a Lindblad master equation: although purely dissipative dynamics stabilizes an entangled state, for any non-vanishing Hamiltonian contribution the system ends up irremediably in a disordered phase. In addition, a single trajectory analysis reveals that the distribution of the entanglement entropy constitutes an efficient indicator of the transition. Complementarily, we explore the competition of the dissipation with coherent dynamics generated by an interacting Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the entanglement transition also occurs in this second model. Our results suggest that this type of transition takes place for a broader class of Hamiltonians, underlining its robustness in monitored open quantum many-body systems.},

abstract = {The dynamics of open Markovian quantum systems are described by Lindblad master equations. For fermionic and bosonic systems that are quasi-free, i.e., with Hamiltonians that are quadratic in the ladder operators and Lindblad operators that are linear in the ladder operators, we derive the equation of motion for the covariance matrix. This determines the evolution of Gaussian initial states and the steady states, which are also Gaussian. Using ladder super-operators (a.k.a. third quantization), we show how the Liouvillian can be transformed to a many-body Jordan normal form which also reveals the full many-body spectrum. Extending previous work by Prosen and Seligman, we treat fermionic and bosonic systems on equal footing with Majorana operators, shorten and complete some derivations, also address the odd-parity sector for fermions, give a criterion for the existence of bosonic steady states, cover non-diagonalizable Liouvillians also for bosons, and include quadratic systems. In extension of the quasi-free open systems, quadratic open systems comprise additional Hermitian Lindblad operators that are quadratic in the ladder operators. While Gaussian states may then evolve into non-Gaussian states, the Liouvillian can still be transformed to a block-triangular form, and the equations of motion for k-point correlation functions form a closed hierarchy. Based on this formalism, results on criticality and dissipative phase transitions in such models will be discussed in a companion paper.},

abstract = {Quantum control optimization algorithms are routinely used to generate optimal quantum gates or efficient quantum state transfers. However, there are two main challenges in designing efficient optimization algorithms, namely overcoming the sensitivity to local optima and improving the computational speed. The former challenge can be dealt with by designing hybrid algorithms, such as a combination of gradient and simulated annealing methods. Here, we propose and demonstrate the use of a machine learning method, specifically the recommender system (RS), to deal with the latter challenge of enhancing computational efficiency. We first describe ways to set up a rating matrix involving gradients or gate fidelities. We then establish that RS can rapidly and accurately predict elements of a sparse rating matrix. Using this approach, we expedite a gradient ascent based quantum control optimization, namely GRAPE and demonstrate the faster performance for up to 8 qubits. Finally, we describe and implement the enhancement of the computational speed of a hybrid algorithm, namely SAGRAPE.},

abstract = {The Hamiltonian H specifies the energy levels and time evolution of a quantum, theory. A standard axiom of quantum mechanics requires that H be Hermitian because Hermiticity guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and that time evolution is unitary (probability-preserving). This paper describes an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics in which the mathematical axiom of Hermiticity (transpose + complex conjugate) is replaced by the physically transparent condition of space-time reflection (PT) symmetry. If H has an unbroken PT symmetry, then the spectrum is real. Examples of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are H = p̂ 2+ix̂3 and H = p̂2 - x̂4. Amazingly, the energy levels of these Hamiltonians are all real and positive! Does a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian H specify a physical quantum theory in which the norms of states are positive and time evolution is unitary? The answer is that if H has an unbroken PT symmetry, then it has another symmetry represented by a linear operator C. In terms of C, one can construct a time-independent inner product with a positive-definite norm. Thus, PT-symmetric Hamiltonians describe a new class of complex quantum theories having positive probabilities and unitary time evolution. The Lee model provides an excellent example of a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. The renormalized Lee-model Hamiltonian has a negative-norm 'ghost' state because renormalization causes the Hamiltonian to become non-Hermitian. For the past 50 years there have been many attempts to find a physical interpretation for the ghost, but all such attempts failed. The correct interpretation of the ghost is simply that the non-Hermitian Lee-model Hamiltonian is PT-symmetric. The C operator for the Lee model is calculated exactly and in closed form and the ghost is shown to be a physical state having a positive norm. The ideas of PT symmetry are illustrated by using many quantum-mechanical and quantum-field-theoretic models. {\textcopyright} 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Extraordinary properties of non-Hermitian systems, ranging from the non-Hermitian skin effect to the supersensitivity to boundary conditions and perturbations, have been widely explored. Whereas these intriguing phenomena have been considered peculiar to non-Hermitian systems, we show that many of them originate from a duality between non-Hermitian models in flat spaces and their counterparts, which could be Hermitian, in curved spaces. For instance, one-dimensional models with chiral tunnelings are equivalent to their duals in two-dimensional hyperbolic spaces. The dictionary translating between non-Hermiticity and curved spaces delivers an unprecedented routine connecting Hermitian and non-Hermitian physics, unfolds deep geometric roots of non-Hermitian phenomena, and establishes non-Hermiticity as a powerful protocol to engineer exotic curved spaces.},

While notions of entanglement have in general little implications for the quantum circuit complexity and the cost of a unitary, in this work, we discuss a simple such relationship when both the entanglement of a state and the cost of a unitary take small values, building on ideas on how values of entangling power of quantum gates add up. This bound implies that if entanglement entropies grow linearly in time, so does the cost. The implications are twofold: It provides insights into complexity growth for short times. In the context of quantum simulation, it allows us to compare digital and analog quantum simulators. The main technical contribution is a continuous-variable small incremental entangling bound.},

Commun. 5 4213) with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through a relaxation of exponential operator splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.},

For a given system observable, the number of such image operators is equal to the dimension of the environment Hilbert space. We derive a perturbative expression, accurate upto arbitrary orders in the system environment coupling, for these image operators in terms of a single one point operator. This expression depends non-linearly on the state of the environment. This perturbative expression can equivalently be thought of as deforming the operator product on the Hilbert space of the open quantum system. In the Markovian limit, the one point operator evolves by an adjoint Lindblad equation. We illustrate these ideas using a simple spin system.},

The BFGS algorithm is frequently unable to find a global minimum for systems beyond about 20 spins and ADAM easily gets trapped in local minima. On the other hand, NatGrad shows stable performance on all considered system sizes, albeit at a significantly higher cost per epoch. In sharp contrast to most classical gradient based learning, the performance of all optimizers is found to decrease upon seemingly benign overparametrization of the ansatz class, with BFGS and ADAM failing more often and more severely than NatGrad. Additional tests for the Heisenberg XXZ model corroborate the accuracy problems of BFGS in high dimensions, but they reveal some shortcomings of NatGrad as well.

This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and which have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},

It was recently conjectured that, for the four-point conformal block, the modular transform up to the non-perturbative contributions can be written in the form of the ordinary Fourier transform when $\beta$ ≡ -1/2 = 1. Here I extend this conjecture to general values of 1, 2. Namely, I argue that, for a properly normalized four-point conformal block the S-duality is perturbatively given by the Fourier transform for arbitrary values of the deformation parameters 1, 2.

abstract = {Given a {\$}generic{\$} two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT), we propose an analytically solvable setup to study the Floquet dynamics of the CFT, i.e., the dynamics of a CFT subject to a periodic driving. A complete phase diagram in the parameter space can be analytically obtained within our setup. We find two phases: the heating phase and the non-heating phase. In the heating phase, the entanglement entropy keeps growing linearly in time, indicating that the system keeps absorbing energy; in the non-heating phase, the entanglement entropy oscillates periodically in time, i.e., the system is not heated. At the phase transition, the entanglement entropy grows logarithmically in time in a universal way. Furthermore, we can obtain the critical exponent by studying the entanglement evolution near the phase transition. Mathematically, different phases (and phase transition) in a Floquet CFT correspond to different types of M{\$}\backslashddot{\{}\backslashtext{\{}o{\}}{\}}{\$}bius transformations.},

abstract = {Deriving effective Hamiltonian models plays an essential role in quantum theory, with particular emphasis in recent years on control and engineering problems. In this work, we present two symbolic methods for computing effective Hamiltonian models: the Non-perturbative Analytical Diagonalization (NPAD) and the Recursive Schrieffer-Wolff Transformation (RSWT). NPAD makes use of the Jacobi iteration and works without the assumptions of perturbation theory while retaining convergence, allowing to treat a very wide range of models. In the perturbation regime, it reduces to RSWT, which takes advantage of an in-built recursive structure where remarkably the number of terms increases only linearly with perturbation order, exponentially decreasing the number of terms compared to the ubiquitous Schrieffer-Wolff method. Both methods consist of elementary algebra and can be easily automated to obtain closed-form expressions. To demonstrate the application of the methods, we study the ZZ interaction of superconducting qubits systems in two different parameter regimes. In the near-resonant regime, the method produces an analytical expression for the effective ZZ interaction strength, with an improvement of at least one order of magnitude compared to neglecting the comparably further detuned state. In the dispersive regime, we calculate perturbative corrections up to the 8th order and accurately identify a regime where ZZ interaction is suppressed in a simple model with only resonator-mediated coupling.},

abstract = {Variational Quantum Algorithms have emerged as a leading paradigm for near-term quantum computation. In such algorithms, a parameterized quantum circuit is controlled via a classical optimization method that seeks to minimize a problem-dependent cost function. Although such algorithms are powerful in principle, the non-convexity of the associated cost landscapes and the prevalence of local minima means that local optimization methods such as gradient descent typically fail to reach good solutions. In this work we suggest a method to improve gradient-based approaches to variational quantum circuit optimization, which involves coupling the output of the quantum circuit to a classical neural network. The effect of this neural network is to peturb the cost landscape as a function of its parameters, so that local minima can be escaped or avoided via a modification to the cost landscape itself. We present two algorithms within this framework and numerically benchmark them on small instances of the Max-Cut optimization problem. We show that the method is able to reach deeper minima and lower cost values than standard gradient descent based approaches. Moreover, our algorithms require essentially the same number of quantum circuit evaluations per optimization step as the standard approach since, unlike the gradient with respect to the circuit, the neural network updates can be estimated in parallel via the backpropagation method. More generally, our approach suggests that relaxing the cost landscape is a fruitful path to improving near-term quantum computing algorithms.},

Dissipation then does not occur as a perturbation, but rather as the main resource for many-body dynamics, providing a targeted cooling into topological phases starting from arbitrary initial states. We explore the concept of topological order in this setting, developing and applying a general theoretical framework based on the system density matrix that replaces the wave function appropriate for the discussion of Hamiltonian ground-state physics. We identify key analogies and differences to the more conventional Hamiltonian scenario. Differences essentially arise from the fact that the properties of the spectrum and of the state of the system are not as tightly related as in the Hamiltonian context. We provide a symmetry-based topological classification of bulk steady states and identify the classes that are achievable by means of quasi-local dissipative processes driving into superfluid paired states. We also explore the fate of the bulk-edge correspondence in the dissipative setting and demonstrate the emergence of Majorana edge modes.

A major open problem in quantum many-body physics is the table-top generation and detection of emergent excitations analogous to gravitons -- the elusive mediators of gravitational force in a quantum theory of gravity. In solid-state materials, fractional quantum Hall phases are one of the leading platforms for realizing graviton-like excitations. However, their direct observation remains an experimental challenge. Here, we generate these excitations on the IBM quantum processor. We first identify an effective one-dimensional model that captures the geometric properties and graviton dynamics of fractional quantum Hall states. We then develop an efficient, optimal-control-based variational quantum algorithm to simulate geometric quench and the subsequent graviton dynamics, which we successfully implement on the IBM quantum computer. Our results open a new avenue for studying the emergence of gravitons in a new class of tractable models that lend themselves to direct implementations on the existing quantum hardware.},

abstract = {Various implementations of the Toffoli gate up to a relative phase have been known for years. The advantage over regular Toffoli gate is their smaller circuit size. However, their use has been often limited to a demonstration of quantum control in designs such as those where the Toffoli gate is being applied last or otherwise for some specific reasons the relative phase does not matter. It was commonly believed that the relative phase deviations would prevent the relative phase Toffolis from being very helpful in practical large-scale designs. In this paper, we report three circuit identities that provide the means for replacing certain configurations of the multiple control Toffoli gates with their simpler relative phase implementations, up to a selectable unitary on certain qubits, and without changing the overall functionality. We illustrate the advantage via applying those identities to the optimization of the known circuits implementing multiple control Toffoli gates, and report the reductions in the CNOT-count, T-count, as well as the number of ancillae used. We suggest that a further study of the relative phase Toffoli implementations and their use may yield other optimizations.},

abstract = {We describe a class of parity- and time-reversal-invariant topological states of matter which can arise in correlated electron systems in 2+1-dimensions. These states are characterized by particle-like excitations exhibiting exotic braiding statistics. P and T invariance are maintained by a 'doubling' of the low-energy degrees of freedom which occurs naturally without doubling the underlying microscopic degrees of freedom. The simplest examples have been the subject of considerable interest as proposed mechanisms for high-Tc superconductivity. One is the 'doubled' version of the chiral spin liquid. The chiral spin liquid gives rise to anyon superconductivity at finite doping and the corresponding field theory is U(1) Chern-Simons theory at coupling constant m = 2. The 'doubled' theory is two copies of this theory, one with m = 2 the other with m = -2. The second example corresponds to Z2 gauge theory, which describes a scenario for spin-charge separation. Our main concern, with an eye towards applications to quantum computation, are richer models which support non-Abelian statistics. All of these models, richer or poorer, lie in a tightly organized discrete family indexed by the Baraha numbers, 2 cos($\pi$/(k + 2)), for positive integer k. The physical inference is that a material manifesting the Z2 gauge theory or a doubled chiral spin liquid might be easily altered to one capable of universal quantum computation. These phases of matter have a field-theoretic description in terms of gauge theories which, in their infrared limits, are topological field theories. We motivate these gauge theories using a parton model or slave-fermion construction and show how they can be solved exactly. The structure of the resulting Hilbert spaces can be understood in purely combinatorial terms. The highly constrained nature of this combinatorial construction, phrased in the language of the topology of curves on surfaces, lays the groundwork for a strategy for constructing microscopic lattice models which give rise to these phases. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Efficient compilation of quantum algorithms is vital in the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. While multiple open-source quantum compilation and circuit optimization frameworks are available, e.g. IBM Qiskit, CQC Tket, Google Cirq, Rigetti Quilc, PyZX, their relative performance is not always clear to a quantum programmer. The growth of complexity and diversity of quantum circuit compilation algorithms creates a demand for a dedicated tool for cross-benchmarking and profiling of inner workflow of the quantum compilation stack. We present an open-source software package, Arline Benchmarks, that is designed to perform automated benchmarking of quantum compilers with the focus on NISQ applications. The name "Arline" was given in honour of Arline Greenbaum Feynman, the first wife of Richard Feynman, the pioneer of quantum computing. We compared several quantum compilation frameworks based on a set of important metrics such as post-optimization gate counts, circuit depth, hardware-dependent circuit cost function, compiler run time etc. with a detailed analysis of metrics for each compilation stage. We performed a variety of compiler tests for random circuits and structured quantum algorithms (VQE, Trotter decomposition, Grover search, Option Pricing via Amplitude Estimation) for several popular quantum hardware architectures. Leveraging cross-platform functionality of Arline, we propose a concept of composite compilation pipeline that combines compiler-specific circuit optimization subroutines in a single compilation stack and finds an optimized sequence of compilation passes. By providing detailed insights into the compilation flow of quantum compilers, Arline Benchmarks offers a valuable toolkit for quantum computing researchers and software developers to gain additional insights into compilers' characteristics.},

abstract = {We study the classical analog of the quantum metric tensor and its scalar curvature for two well-known quantum physics models. First, we analyze the geometry of the parameter space for the Dicke model with the aid of the classical and quantum metrics and find that, in the thermodynamic limit, they have the same divergent behavior near the quantum phase transition, as opposed to their corresponding scalar curvatures which are not divergent there. On the contrary, under resonance conditions, both scalar curvatures exhibit a divergence at the critical point. Second, we present the classical and quantum metrics for the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model in the thermodynamic limit and find a perfect agreement between them. We also show that the scalar curvature is only defined on one of the system's phases and that it approaches a negative constant value. Finally, we carry out a numerical analysis for the system's finite sizes, which clearly shows the precursors of the quantum phase transition in the metric and its scalar curvature and allows their characterization as functions of the parameters and of the system's size.},

@article{Morrison2015,
abstract = {I present a method of calculating the coefficients appearing in the Jones-Wenzl projections in the Temperley-Lieb algebras. It essentially repeats the approach of Frenkel and Khovanov published in 1997. I wrote this note mid-2002, not knowing about their work, but then set it aside upon discovering their article. Recently I decided to dust it off and place it on the arXiv --- hoping the self-contained and detailed proof I give here may be useful. It's also been cited a number of times, so I thought it best to give it a permanent home. The proof is based upon a simplification of the Wenzl recurrence relation. I give an example calculation, and compare this method to the formula announced by Ocneanu and partially proved by Reznikoff. I also describe certain moves on diagrams which modify their coefficients in a simple way.},

@article{Barthel2020,
abstract = {In the thermodynamic limit, the steady states of open quantum many-body systems can undergo nonequilibrium phase transitions due to a competition between Hamiltonian and dissipative terms. Here, we consider Markovian systems and elucidate structures of the Liouville super-operator that generates the dynamics. In many cases of interest, a non-orthogonal basis transformation can bring the Liouvillian into block-triangular form, making it possible to assess its spectrum. The spectral gap sets the asymptotic decay rate. The super-operator structure can be used to bound gaps from below, showing that, in a large class of systems, dissipative phase transitions are actually impossible and that the convergence to steady states is exponential. Furthermore, when the blocks on the diagonal are Hermitian, the Liouvillian spectra obey Weyl ordering relations. The results are exemplified by various spin models.},

abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are proposed to solve relevant computational problems on near term quantum devices. Popular versions are variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) and quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOAs) that solve ground state problems from quantum chemistry and binary optimization problems, respectively. They are based on the idea to use a classical computer to train a parameterized quantum circuit. We show that the corresponding classical optimization problems are NP-hard. Moreover, the hardness is robust in the sense that for every polynomial time algorithm, there exists instances for which the relative error resulting from the classical optimization problem can be arbitrarily large, unless P = NP. Even for classically tractable systems, composed of only logarithmically many qubits or free fermions, we show that the optimization is NP-hard. This elucidates that the classical optimization is intrinsically hard and does not merely inherit the hardness from the ground state problem. Our analysis shows that the training landscape can have many far from optimal persistent local minima. This means gradient and higher order decent algorithms will generally converge to far from optimal solutions.},

The electromagnetic field due to alternating poloidal currents in a toroidal solenoid is evaluated exactly via the solution of the inhomogeneous vector Helmholtz equations, using the outgoing wave Green function technique and the Debye potentials for sources and fields. The physical meaning of the toroidal moments can be appreciated when they are compared with the familiar electric and magnetic moments; the analysis of the long-wavelength limit of the exact results also explains the previous neglect of the toroidal moments. The magnetostatic limit and the point source limit are also physically and didactically interesting.},

In particular, it turns out that {\$}15{\$} and {\$}63{\$} {\$}CNOT{\$} gates are sufficient to decompose a general {\$}3{\$}- and {\$}4{\$}-qubit unitary, respectively. This is currently the lowest achieved gate count compared to other algorithms. Our approach is based on a sequential optimization of parameters related to the single-qubit rotation gates involved in a pre-designed quantum circuit used for the decomposition. In addition, the algorithm can be adopted to sparse inter-qubit connectivity architectures provided by current mid-scale quantum computers, needing only a few additional {\$}CNOT{\$} gates to be implemented in the resulting quantum circuits.},

@article{Radescu2002,
abstract = {An exact calculation of the radiation intensity, angular momentum loss, and the recoil force for the most general type of source, characterized by electric, magnetic, and toroid multipole moments and radii of any multipolarity and an arbitrary time dependence, is presented. The results are expressed in terms of time derivatives of the multipole moments and mean radii of the corresponding distributions. Although quite cumbersome, the formulas found by us represent exact results in the correct multipole analysis of configurations of charges and currents that contain toroidal sources. So the longstanding problem in classical electrodynamics of relating the radiation properties of a system to quantities completely describing its internal electromagnetic structure is thereby exactly solved. By particularizations to the first multipole contributions, corrections to the familiar formulas from books are found, mostly on account of the toroid moments and their interference with the usual electric and magnetic ones. {\textcopyright} 2002 The American Physical Society.},

year = {2013},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned.In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included. A hyperparameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task (PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single broad class of feed-forward vision architectures.},
